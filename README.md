# Digital Voting
It is an online voting system with face recognition and two factor authentication, developed in django framework.  Digital voting has admin login which will be handled by election commission and voter login which will be handled by voter. Voters can login through their voter ID number and password after a successful registration. The system will allows voters to view a list of candidates in their area, voters can get to know the candidates background (like income, works, etc.) and choose wisely. Once the election is started voter have to login into the account, select a candidate and have to give face id with webcam or front camera, if the face matches with the face given at the time of registration then voter will be promoted for two factor authentication, if two factor authentication is successful then the vote will be submitted and one voter can vote for a candidate only once per election.
